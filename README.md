# What can I do with it?

- **Key-path management—** The key-paths of the layer and asset used in the lottile file are provided as a tree view. This is the easiest way to manage many key-paths.

- **Highlighting—**  Highlighting effect is provided to a componenet selected through the key-path.

- **Access and change the actual properties—** Users can access the properties of components in the actual file, change the value, and integrate it into a new json file.

- **Task management—** Users want to try various changes with preview and find animation in good changes. The edited task records are managed internally and Users can be moved freely to the desired point.

- **New tools for canvas and background—**  An essential element for creating custom design tooling. In prettie, Users can customize background, position and size to create desired scene.

- **Mockup tool —** Users want to see lottie animation with product. Provides a preview with several mockups.
